# Communications System & Possible Archipelago World for Stellaris

## Description
This is my attempt at establishing an in/out system of communication between Stellaris and a Python program *(mostly successful)* and writing an [Archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg/) world for it *(currently in progress)*.

## Usage
1. Download this repository. 
2. *Optionally* Run **CreateEvents.py** to regenerate events in the mod
3. From the **mod** folder, grab the **testresource** folder and the **testresource.mod** files and put them into your game
4. Activate the mod in your Playset
5. Launch Stellaris and get into a game
6. You should see an Event pop up telling you some things. Click OK.
7. Run **Main.py** and watch the magic.
